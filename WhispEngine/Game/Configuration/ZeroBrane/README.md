Whisp Engine has a in engine script editor, however it does not have an autocomplete function. In order to fix that, 
[ZeroBrane Studio](https://studio.zerobrane.com/) is a lightweight Lua IDE with code completion, syntax highlighting, live coding and code analyzer that allows
the creation of custom autocomplete API. Whisp Engine has an autocomplete function in ZeroBrane.
